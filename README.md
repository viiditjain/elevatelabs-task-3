# AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to understand data distribution, patterns, relationships between features, and identify important variables for future machine learning tasks.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
- **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## 🔍 Task Overview
The following EDA steps were performed:

- Loaded and inspected the dataset structure
- Performed basic data cleaning for analysis
- Analyzed numerical features using histograms
- Analyzed categorical features using count plots
- Used box plots to detect outliers
- Created correlation heatmap to study feature relationships
- Identified important features for prediction
- Summarized insights from each visualization

---

## 📈 Key Visual Insights
- Majority of Netflix content was released after **2010**
- Movies are more frequent than TV Shows
- **TV-MA** and **TV-14** are the most common content ratings
- Older movies appear as outliers in release year
- United States is the top content-producing country
- Release year and year added show moderate correlation

---

## 🔑 Important Features Identified
- `type` (Movie / TV Show)
- `release_year`
- `rating`
- `country`
- `duration`

These features are useful for recommendation systems and content-based analysis.
